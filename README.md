# pychat
My first Python program. Don't use it for references, suggestions are open, I'm just making this to learn the ropes of programming.
This repository will probably become extremely messy or unlogical, that is as result of my experimentation. If something is done extremely inefficiently, please do suggest a better way, although there is still all possibility that I am simply experimenting.
